# Sanity studio for Funkit

A website with CMS for the non-profit organisation Funkit in VÃ¤rmland to easier spread information about their awesome events.

---

## To the dev 

You can find the frontend code [here](https://github.com/MonBjo/funkit-frontend).

1. **When updating the Studio exports**, don't forget to check the `src/lib/utils` folder at the frontend and mostly the `sanity.ts` file as that is where all the data is fetched!

2. Make sure the Studio is like a walk in the park.
